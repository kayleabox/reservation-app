// Today you will be building a Node / Express based web applications for handling reservation requests.

// Your application will be made up of two parts: 
// 1) A front-end set of HTML/CSS/JS pages for entering and viewing data and 
// 2) A back-end composed of Node/Express and basic JS for storing, updating, and relaying reservation data.

// Spend the time necessary to map this application out. Consider the concepts we've covered in class so far:

// Servers
// Routing
// APIs
// AJAX (GET and POST Requests)
// You should be referencing the code from the previous Star Wars application.

// Feel encouraged to use the following application as a reference: http://hot-restaurant.herokuapp.com/

// Note: We know this is a hard activity. We know you aren't yet comfortable with Node or Express. 
// But push yourself. The best way to learn is to push through the discomfort and BUILD! 
// Ask for help when you need it. We're here to help you through the process.


// Phase II: For this second phase, aim to complete the following:
// Backend Team:
// Create a basic Express server.
// Your server at this point should do the BARE MINIMUM. (Effectively, it should just say:
//  "Listening at PORT 3000" when the command node server.js is run.)
// Frontend Team:
// Create three HTML files one called home.html, another called tables.html, and another called reserve.html. 
// Use dummy data and create pages similar to the one shown to you on the sample Hot Reservation webpage.
// All: If you finish early, begin thinking about how the Data, API, and Routes should look.

// Phase III: For this third phase, aim to complete the following:

// Backend Team:

// Create a set of variables (hint: arrays of objects) for holding the reservation and waitlist data

// Create a set of routes that then display this data as JSONs. Users should be given these JSONs if 
// they visit the appropriate page (i.e. if a user visits localhost:3000/api/tables they should see a JSON of 
// table data).

// Frontend Team:

// Temporarily join the backend team. Your task will be to create Express routes that display your HTML 
// pages when a user visits the appropriate page. (i.e. if a user visits localhost:3000/tables... they should be
//  shown the table.html page.)

// If you finish early begin creating the code necessary to convert your form data into JSON objects.
